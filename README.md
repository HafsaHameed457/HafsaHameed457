# 👋 Hellowww, Hafsa Hameed here!!!

Welcome to my corner of GitHub! 👩‍💻 I’m a software engineer who’s all about solving puzzles, fixing bugs, and making tech work *smoothly*. Tech has been treating me really well, and I love giving back by creating things that actually make a difference.

## 🚀 What I’m All About  

- **Frontend Geek**: Building snappy UIs with React, Next.js, and styled-components.  
- **Backend Wizardry**: Crafting APIs in Node.js and sometimes spicing it up with FastAPI.  

📚 Constantly learning, whether it’s a new framework, a book, or from a bug that kept me up all night (it happens, don’t judge).
