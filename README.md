# 👋 Hellowww, Hafsa Hameed here!!!

Welcome to my corner of GitHub! 👩‍💻 I’m a software engineer who’s all about solving puzzles, fixing bugs, and making tech work *smoothly*. Tech has been treating me really well since 2020, and I love giving back by creating things that actually make a difference.

## 🚀 What I’m All About  

- **Frontend Geek**: Building catchy front-end of application.  
- **Backend Wizardry**: Crafting APIs in Node.js and sometimes spicing it up with FastAPI.  

📚 Constantly learning, whether it’s a new framework, a book, or from a bug that kept me up all night (it happens, don’t judge).

## 🔧 Tools & Tech I Love  

- **Frontend**: React, Tailwind CSS, styled-components
- **Backend**: Node.js Express, FastAPI, NextJs, Flask
- **Other Cool Stuff**: Docker and AWS

## 🌱 What I’m Up To  

- 🎯 Preparing for **AWS Certified Developer – Associate** certification.  
- 🎧 Jogging to audiobooks and *sometimes* pretending I’m in a movie montage.
